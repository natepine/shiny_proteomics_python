#   MassPike servers and authentication
#
#   Each entry represents an available MassPike instance
#   Replace `my.masspike.com` with your URL
    my.masspike.com:
#       Replace `admin` with a user on your masspike instance with permission to view all user's data
#       Used to provide access to viewer link without authentication
        User: admin #Required
#       Replace `api_key` with an api key for the above User
        Key: api_key #Required
#       Replace `MassPike` with the UI name of this server
        Label: MassPike #Optional [Defaults to server URL]
#       Replace `true` with `false` to allow self-signed SSL certificates for this server
        VerifySSL: true #Optional [Defaults to true]

#Optional viewer subdirectory for reverse proxied urls.
#Otherwise '${APP_NAME}/IsoViewer' will be used in viewer links, using the ${APP_NAME} from `.env`
#Note: If APP_NAME is empty ('') or not in the environment at runtime, 'shinyproteomics' will be used for viewer links.
#VIEWER_SUBDIR: viewer_app #Optional [Defaults to 'shinyproteomics']

#Allow users with this password to view all users' links and access the full 'Advanced' tab
SUPER_USER_PASSWORD: secret_password #Optional [Defaults to full access to all users]

#Define which species the user can select in the editor
ANNOTATED_SPECIES: #Optional [Defaults to no annotation UI]
#   Format is (Label: taxid)*
#   Where Label is the UI name of the entry and taxid is the NCBI taxonomy id for annotation data
    Human: 9606
    Mouse: 10090
    Other: .na # .na indicates no annotations

#The app will look for a table in data/annotation.db named 'annnotations_*taxid*' for annotations. If nothing is found annotation enrichment tables are omitted.
#   The table is expected to have columns UniprotID, Database, DatabaseID where DatabaseID is the id from Database which is one of
#       GO <type>
#           Molecular Function
#           Cellular Component
#           Biological Process
#       KEGG <type>
#           Pathway
#           Disease
#       Reactome
#       Interpro

#When loading a dataset the app will look in the data/idMaps dir within docker's volume for '*taxid*.rds' and
#attempt to map any ids returned by MassPike to provided ids
#   If final ids are not UniprotIDs, annotation enrichment and Uniprot links will not work
#   The rds file is expected to contain a vector of UniprotIDs values, named with the corresponding MassPike ids.

#Display contact information for server adminstrator
ADMIN_EMAIL: tmt_admin@tmt_server.org #Optional [Defaults to no displayed contact for resolving issues]
